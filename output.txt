Recognized nonterms: S
Recognized terms: a, b

Parsed rules: 
S  ->  a S S b S  |  a S a S b  |  a b b  |  b

Avoid left recursion
S  ->  a S S b S  |  a S a S b  |  a b b  |  b

Delete epsilon - products
S  ->  a S S b S  |  a S a S b  |  a b b  |  b

Remove double recursion
S  ->  a S S b S  |  a S a S b  |  a b b  |  b

Isolate biggest common terminals
S  ->  a S'  |  b
S'  ->  S S''  |  b b
S''  ->  S b S  |  a S b
